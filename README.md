# Summary

The OSSU curriculum is a **complete education in mathematics** using online materials.
It's for those who want a proper grounding in concepts fundamental to all math disciplines,
and for those who have the discipline, will, and good habits to obtain this education largely on their own,
but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate math majors, minus general education (non-math) requirements,
as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS.
The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, MIT, Stanford, etc.,
but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria.

**Courses must**:
- Match our [curricular guidelines](CURRICULAR_GUIDELINES.md) the 2015 CUPM Guide.
- Be open for enrollment
- Run regularly (ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running multiple times per year)
- Be of high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical practice

When no course meets the above criteria, the coursework is supplemented with a book.

**Duration**. It is possible to finish the curriculum within about 2 years if you plan carefully and devote roughly 18-22 hours/week to your studies.

**Cost**. OSSU strives to identify free resources to reach your learning goal. However, some courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded.

Decide how much or how little to spend based on your own time and budget;
just remember that you can't purchase success!

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses in order from top to bottom, as they have already been sorted by their prerequisites.
- Courses in Applications are electives. Choose one subject you want to become an expert in and take all the courses under that heading. You can also create your own custom subject (we recommend getting validation from the community on the subject you choose).

**Content policy**. If you plan on showing off some of your coursework publicly, you must share only files that you are allowed to.
*Respect the code of conduct that you sign in the beginning of each course!*

## Congratulations

After completing the requirements of the curriculum above, you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Mathematics. Congratulations!

What is next for you? The possibilities are boundless and overlapping:

- Look for a job. Mathematicians go into careers as statisticians, financial analysts, actuaries and more!
- Join a local math club (e.g. via [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)).
- Pay attention to emerging ideas in mathematics by subscribing to a math journal or joining a professional math organization.

## How to show your progress

1. Create an account in [Trello](https://trello.com/).
1. Copy this (**TODO**) board to your personal account.
See how to copy a board [here](https://help.trello.com/article/802-copying-cards-lists-or-boards).

Now that you have a copy of our official board, you just need to pass the cards to the `Doing` column or `Done` column as you progress in your study.
